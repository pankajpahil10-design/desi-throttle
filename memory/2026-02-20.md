## Session Notes

- Switched from MiniMax to local Ollama/Qwen2.5 for free inference (zero token cost)
- Config patched: added ollama provider with qwen2.5:latest as primary model
- Gateway restarted to apply local LLM config
- User expressed frustration: felt like talking to "service provider" instead of "homie" after model switch
- User is broke; token costs are a concern
